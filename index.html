    <h1>Water In My Ear </h1>
    <p>The doctors said that I should type out my life, so that I wouldn't forget who I am. I can't remeber my name or much of what I look like but I do rember having short curly hair and being about 17. Now my hair is just short and wet no matter how many time me and the doctors try to dry it. Actually Dr.Mile says drying my hair is like trying to dry a lake with a towel. Anyways I'm writing this cause in the past few months i've been lossing bits and pieces of my memmory, at first the doctors told me to just us a notebook but I want the world to know about me. </p>
