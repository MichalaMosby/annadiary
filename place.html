<P> Okay so I used to live in this big beautiful house that was a nice pale color outside with a pretty grey roof. We had a big back yard with a swing set and lake, every night I would let Jesssica and Adam swing before bed. Even though they weren't supposed too. It was in a small town areound 2,000 so nothing ever reallly happened.<P>

</body>I loved the town it was a mixture of many diiferent people from itaian to jamacian. You know the turm "it takes a village to raise a kid" it was turn for us. We would run around with the other toown kids and would often get to try their foods. We would even help make the fod somethimes. It might seem lame to city people but i wouldn't change anything, it was the most fun thing in the world.
