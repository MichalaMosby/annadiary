	<h1>The Incident</h1>
<p> I don't really wanna talk about this but I also don't wanna forget. 
<br> 
<br> 
<p>Since our parents were always working I never expeted anything from them. So you could propble guess how surprised me and my siblings were when mom and Dad said they had a "surprise" for us. Yeah it was a great surprise. Things are kind of suzzy from here but I think my father had us drink something in celecbration. And the next thing I knew I'm being dragged some where while blind folded. I was so scared I just started screaming but was quickly huhsed by my father. I begged and pleaded for him to tell me what he was doing. Then there was a splash and I found myself sinking to the bottom of the lake. I could get free and the water was so loud in my ears it was as if someone was powerwashing my ear. And my lungs burneed with the need to breath.The pressure pushed against my chest threating to break it. Everything just started hurting the cold water started eating away at my skin until....everything went quiet. Then I was able to breath but I was still under water. I was even able to see everything with the blind fold on not as the way you would see something. Everything was grey it was like I was seeing shadows instead of fish. Finally I was able to free myself from whatever was waying me own. I made my way out of the lake and vomited up at least 2 gallions of water<p>
